## JSON-Serve

By serving a json file as a rest api server, you can create a testing api within a minute with JSON-Serve.

### Note

Inspired by this awesome package [typicode/json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), I would like to create one by myself, with no dependency.

### Usage

```shell
yarn install:local
yarn json-serve [json-file] [port]
```
